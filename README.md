#Todo Functionality

This is a To-Do application built using React stack. The app allows users to:

--> Add tasks with a title, description, and priority.
--> Mark tasks as completed and view them in a separate "Completed" section.
--> Prioritize tasks based on importance.
--> Search through tasks.
--> Persist tasks in local storage so that tasks remain even after refreshing the page.
--> Delete tasks.

#Setup and Launch Process

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

--> Clone the repository: https://github.com/vikashah007/Todo_React.git
cd Todo_React

--> Install dependencies for React :
npm i

--> Run the application:
npm run start

Assumptions Made During Development
--> Local storage is used for persistence, and no backend database is required for this version.
--> when completed todo tab is clicked then seachbar and priority button will be hidden
